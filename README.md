# Remote-sensing
Purpose of this project was training neural network for detection different objects on the satellite images. This was achievied with a help 
of CNN implemented in Keras. 

**Data**
- Dataset consists of manually extracted satellite images with same resolutions. 
- Example of image:

- From the images have benn extracted 8 types of objects: cars, crosswalks, separate trees, forests, houses, roads, swimming pools, and samples of lands. 
- Each sample has been preprocessed, from each sample script has created a large amount of different samples. 
- Example of processing:
